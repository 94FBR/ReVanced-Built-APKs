# ReVanced-Built-APKs
Built APKs from ReVanced, made for archive purposes but ehh I guess I'll make it public for the people having a hard time building the app.

APKs were built using https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder/wiki/How-to-use-revanced-builder-on-Android on my Poco X3 Pro.
Contact if newer updates are released.
